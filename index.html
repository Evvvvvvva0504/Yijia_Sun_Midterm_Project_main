                    Wild pets, in the context of responsible pet ownership, typically refer to animals that are 
                    not traditionally considered domesticated but are kept as pets. These animals are distinct 
                    from wildlife found in their natural habitats and may include exotic or non-traditional 
                    species.<br> It should be noted that, Keeping wild pets is subject to legal regulations and 
                    ethical considerations, and it often requires specialized care and knowledge to provide them 
                    with a safe and enriched environment. Hence, prior research and responsible ownership and 
                    dedication is recommended.<br>
